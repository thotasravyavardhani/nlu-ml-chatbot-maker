1. Run the Command Prompt as Administrator
The most common fix for symbolic link creation failures on Windows is to run the terminal with elevated permissions.

Deactivate your virtual environment:

Bash

(snips_env) E:\Infosys Internship - NLU Chatbot\Assessment 6 - SNIPS NLU\Snips NLU Chatbot>deactivate
Close your current Command Prompt window.

Open a new Commancd Ed Prompt by searching for "cmd," right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as administrator."

Navigate back to your project directory.

Bash

C:\WINDOWS\system32>E:
E:\>cd Infosys Internship - NLU Chatbot\Assessment 7 - SNIPS NLU\Snips NLU Chatbot
Activate your virtual environment again:

Bash

E:\Infosys Internship - NLU Chatbot\Assessment 7 - SNIPS NLU\Snips NLU Chatbot>.\snips_env\Scripts\activate
Re-run the language resource download command:

Bash

(snips_env) E:\Infosys Internship - NLU Chatbot\Assessment 7 - SNIPS NLU\Snips NLU Chatbot>python -m snips_nlu download en
This should now successfully create the necessary symbolic link.
