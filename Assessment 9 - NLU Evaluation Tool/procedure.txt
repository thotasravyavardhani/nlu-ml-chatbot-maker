To run the NLU evaluation, you need to execute the Python script evaluate_nlu.py.

This process involves two main steps: Setup (installing required libraries) and Execution (running the script from your terminal).

1. Setup: Installing Dependencies
Your evaluation script uses specialized NLU and metrics libraries. Before running, ensure you have the necessary packages installed in your Python environment.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

Bash

pip install snips-nlu scikit-learn seqeval
Library	Purpose
snips-nlu	Required to load and train your NLU engine using dataset.json.
scikit-learn	Required for calculating Intent metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix).
seqeval	Required (conceptually) for calculating Entity/Slot sequence-level F1 scores.

Export to Sheets
2. Execution: Running the Script
Make sure you have all three required files—dataset.json, test_data.json, and evaluate_nlu.py—in the same directory.

In your terminal, execute the script directly using Python:

Bash

python evaluate_nlu.py
What the Script Does:
Training: The script first calls the train_engine() function, which loads your dataset.json and trains the SnipsNLUEngine.

Evaluation: It then calls evaluate_nlu_model(), which does the following for every utterance in test_data.json:

Feeds the utterance into the trained model (engine.parse(utterance)).

Collects the model's predictions (y_pred_intent, y_pred_slots).

Collects the expected results (y_true_intent, y_true_slots) from test_data.json.

Reporting: Finally, it uses the collected lists to print the detailed evaluation reports:

Full Match Accuracy (Intent + all Slots correct).

Intent Accuracy and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score per intent).

Confusion Matrix (visualizing misclassified intents).

The output will be printed directly to your terminal, providing the metrics and analysis you need.
