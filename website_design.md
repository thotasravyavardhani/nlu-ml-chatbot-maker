<user_request>Bro I need a NLU APP with some images and all
1. Main Home page about our project introduction 
2. Signin/ Register using JWT 
3. On entering profile page it welcomes and ask for new workspace along with already existed workspaces
4. On creating new workspace it has to ask for name and any description
5. And then It has to ask for upload any dataset , and then train , prediction like for Machine Learning and at a time, it has to perform some ML Algorithms like for all these add a sidebar and include all 
upload dataset, train, predict, model evaluation metrics - Accuracy, Precision, Matrix, Graphs, F1 Score all ,NLU Chatbot- Using RASA and Trained model, NLU Annotation Tool - USINg Rasa, Model Metadata, 
Like a NLU Chatbot Maker , It must allow any no large of dataset and must run and make sure like its NLU + ML Chatbot maker and trainer and for ML it has to at a time perform 5 to 6 ML Algorithms and it has to finalize the model with higher accuracy and that only be considered for that workspace all and also NLU Chatbot . and also enable users to download that ML Models as pickle or h5 and they can train again, and also enable retraining module and also if possible be more creative add some more or any other like it has to perform ML algorithms here and also enable showing csv , download csv, while train selecting target column all
And at main home along with workspace, user settings, profile add them and any help 
make sure add some images looks professional not empty or spatial</user_request>

<todo_list>
1. Create homepage with professional hero section, project introduction, features overview, and how-it-works section with relevant AI/ML images. Add navigation header with Sign In/Register buttons and footer
2. Build authentication system with sign-in/register pages using JWT, create API routes for auth, and implement protected routes with middleware
3. Create dashboard page with workspace management (list existing workspaces, create new workspace modal with name/description fields), user profile section with welcome message, and settings page
4. Build workspace detail page with sidebar navigation containing: dataset upload (CSV viewer/downloader with column selection), train module (runs multiple ML algorithms - Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost), model evaluation dashboard (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix with charts), and model download/retrain functionality (pickle/h5 export)
5. Implement NLU chatbot interface with RASA integration for training/prediction, add annotation tool for intent/entity labeling, display model metadata, and create interactive chat widget for testing trained models
